### Statistical Learning
- #### Machine Learning 
  - build prediction function that are useful in linking different observations, to classifying observations, or learning the structure in an unlabeled dataset.
  - statistical inferences : drawing conclusion on dataset at hand.
- #### Estimator
  - Any object that learns from data.
  - such as classification algorithms, regression algorithms, clustering algorithm or transformers.
